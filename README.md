## Woodpecker Method

The Woodpecker method, as described in *The Woodpecker Method* by Axel Smith and Hans Tikkanen, involves solving the same *set* of puzzles over different *cycles*. Here's the instructions as summarized on page 29:

>**Step 1)** Cycle 1: Solve a set of exercises over approximately four weeks  
**Step 2)** Take at least the next day off  
**Step 3)** Cycle 2: Solve the same set, but within two weeks  
**Step 4)** Repeat steps 2-3, completing each cycle in half the number of days
(rounded up where necessary)  
**Step 5)** The method is complete when the set has been solved in one day (or after
seven cycles)

This method is similar to the Seven Cirlces program outlined by Michael de la Maza in *Rapid Chess Improvement*. (See [this discussion.](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/the-seven-circles-program)) Both methods involve solving the same set of chess puzzles in multiple cycles, and decreasing the amount of time spent on each puzzle each time.

As outlined in *The Woodpecker Method*'s introduction, the claimed benefits of the Woodpecker method involve training one's tactical intuition via pattern recognition. The development of this pattern recognition is claimed to be made easier by the fact that the puzzles remain the same in each cycle, eliminating the added -- and what is claimed to be unnecessary -- challenge of puzzle novelty.

The Woodpecker method is not without its [valid critiques](
